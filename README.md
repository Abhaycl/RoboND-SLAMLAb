# RoboND-SLAMLab
In this lab, youâ€™ll implement a gmapping ROS package which is based on the Grid-based FastSLAM algorithm to map an environment.

### Steps to Launch the Simulation:
Launch the simulation in the VM machine provided in Term1. 

#### Step 1 Create a Catkin Workspace:
Skipt this step if you already have a workspace
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

#### Step 2 Perform a System Update:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
```

#### Step 3 Clone the Package in src:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-SLAMLab
```

#### Step 4 Launch the nodes:
```sh
$ cd RoboND-SLAMLab
$ ./SLAM.sh
```
Now, you should see Gazebo and rviz launching.

### End Result:
In the terminal, use the keyboard commands(u-i-o-j-k-l-m-,-.) and drive the robot around. You'll see a map of the environment in Gazebo!
